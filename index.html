<h2><strong>Welcome to the Sushi monthly recap! 🗞</strong><br />
<br />
This post will outline some of the major operational, technical, and community milestones reached in the past month. We&rsquo;ve summarized all articles and announcements as well as some of the exciting things to come &mdash; as laid out in the Sushi roadmap. Without further ado, let&rsquo;s dive into the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
With this focus on true multi-chain experiences, we here at Sushi took the path of a complete architecture overhaul with 2.0 that really starts to unlock the potential of the horizontal scaling we&rsquo;ve done across many different chains. Excited by this chain agnostic future, today at Sushi we are announcing the release of the first phase of our Sushi 2.0 UI: swaps, earn, and analytics all with 15 chains in one place.<br />
<br />
<strong>Multi-Chain First Applications</strong><br />
<br />
Over the last cycle, we saw the growth in demand for additional block space on EVM-based chains whether it be layer 1 or 2. With over $23 billion of $54 billion in TVL being deployed across various chains outside of Ethereum, the direction is clear for a multi-chain rich future and at Sushi we are solely focused on building truly chain agnostic applications.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://suishiswap.github.io">SushiSwap</a> was the first iteration on this multi-chain first approach, being the first ever cross-chain swap AMM and already showing good usage with swaps between: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, Fantom, Binance Smart Chain.<br />

Phase One<br />
<br />
<a href="http://suishiswap.github.io">Sushiswap</a> 2.0 in its first phase features a revamped look to improve the experience for our users with swaps, liquidity management, staking and analytics.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://suishiswap.github.io">Sushiswap</a> 2.0 supports: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, MoonRiver, Gnosis, Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, Celo, Fuse, Arbitrum Nova, Optimism, Polygon, Metis, Boba and Kava.<br />
<br />
All 15 chains can be accessed through each of these applications, and more will come in the second phase to make the experience even more seamless.</h2>
